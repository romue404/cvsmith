about_me: "I am a man of logic and deduction, devoted to the pursuit of truth and justice in cases that baffle Scotland Yard. My methods are scientific and systematic—where others see confusion, I perceive order and pattern. I apply the exact sciences of observation, chemistry, and criminal analysis to matters that lie beyond the reach of ordinary Scotland Yard inspectors. Between cases of importance, I maintain my monographs on tobacco ash varieties and conduct experiments in chemical analysis. The game, as I have so often remarked, is afoot."
